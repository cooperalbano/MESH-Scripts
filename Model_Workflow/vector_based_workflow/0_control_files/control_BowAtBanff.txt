# MESH vector-based workflow setting file based on SUMMA workflow setting file.
# Characters '|' and '#' are used as separators to find the actual setting values. Any text behind '|' is assumed to be part of the setting value, unless preceded by '#'.

# Note on path specification
# If deviating from default paths, a full path must be specified. E.g. '/home/user/non-default/path'


# Modeling domain settings
root_path                   | user_running_dir       					  # Root folder where data will be stored.
domain_name                 | BowAtBanff                                  # Used as part of the root folder name for the prepared data.

# Shapefile settings - river network file

river_network_shp_slope     | slope                                       # Name of the slope column. Slope must be in in units [length/length].
river_network_shp_length    | lengthkm                                    # Name of the segment length column. Length must be in units [m].
river_network_shp_outlet_id | 71028585                                    # ID of the most downstream segment in the river network (river network shapefile). Note that this specifies a single segment ID value. It is not a column in the shapefile.


# Shapefile settings - catchment file
river_basin_shp_path        | default                                     # If 'default', uses 'root_path/domain_[name]/shapefiles/river_basins'.

river_basin_shp_area        | unitarea                                    # Name of the catchment area column. Area must be in units [m^2]
river_basin_shp_hru_to_seg  | COMID                                  	  # Name of the column that shows which river segment each HRU connects to.

# Experiment settings - routing
settings_routing_path          | default                                  # If 'default', uses 'root_path/domain_[name]/settings/routing'.

# Default folder structure
# Example of the resulting folder structure in "root_path". 
# New domains will go into their own folder.
