# Project Title
Vector-based routing in MESH

## Team
  - MESH workflow development: Ala Bahrami (USASK) and Cooper Albano (USASK)  
  - MESH code support: Daniel Princz (ECCC) 
  - Geospatial support : Shervan Gharari(USASK) and Kasra Keshavarz (USASK)
  - CWARHM workflow: Wouter Knoben (USASK) 
  - Advisors: Bruce Davison (ECCC), Alain Pietroniro (UofC), and Martyn Clark (USASK) 

## Date
The project has been started in November 2020. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide series of code for applied testing MESH-vector-based version. The project later has been expanded to automate the implementation of the workflow for the entire North America implementation.


## Objectives and Main Tasks
  * Develop codes for setup the MESH model for any domain of interest. 


## Progress / Conclusion
The preliminary stage of this project has been accomplished. The workflow has been tested for the Bow@Banff and Fraser River Basins.
